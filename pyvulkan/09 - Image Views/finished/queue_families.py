            queueFlags is a bitmask of VkQueueFlagBits indicating capabilities of the queues in this queue family.

            queueCount is the unsigned integer count of queues in this queue family. Each queue family must support 
            at least one queue.

            timestampValidBits is the unsigned integer count of meaningful bits in the timestamps written via 
            vkCmdWriteTimestamp. The valid range for the count is 36..64 bits, or a value of 0, 
            indicating no support for timestamps. Bits outside the valid range are guaranteed to be zeros.

            minImageTransferGranularity is the minimum granularity supported for image transfer 
            operations on the queues in this queue family.
